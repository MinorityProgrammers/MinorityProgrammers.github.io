            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>Minority Programmers Association strives to create a diverse, multidisciplinary community using
              technical
              knowledge to develop globally minded projects. We strive to motivate our members through community
              outreach and professional development events. Our solutions are intended to be humanitarian in nature
              and
              socially impactful. We hope to uplift underprivileged communities, diversity the Science Technology
              Engineering and Mathematics discipline, and approach problems from a software engineering perspective.
            </p>
            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
              The Minority Programmers Association was originally founded in 2019 by a group of culturally diverse
              Computer Science, SMAD, Intelligence Analysis, and Business students as a national organization aimed to
              diversify the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field by allowing a space for
              minorities to develop humanitarian software solutions for communities in need.
            </p>
            <p>With its first chapter at JMU, MPA uses a project-based learning approach to not only train its members
              on programming practices but other frontier software development practices as well. The organization
              aims
              to attract members from a wide variety of disciplines that utilize technology in their studies. The
              diversity of the organization aids effective problem solving as we work on impactful humanitarian
              projects.</p>

            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>The Minority Programmers Association overall vision is to both diversify the STEM field to reflect a
              diverse world and channel this technological empowerment to fuel humanitarian change. A facet of
              achieving
              diversity in STEM is both establishing a professional network of programmers from across the world, but
              also educating members of this network with both soft and technical skills, further investing in this
              world’s future. Moreover, as part of this principle of community outreach, MPA intends to implement
              local
              outreach with introductory programming courses through our local chapter model.</p>
            <h1>Objectives</h1>
            <p>Our main objectives are as follows:
              <li>Diversifying STEM related fields</li>
              <li>Training and placing ally programmers in job opportunities</li>
              <li>Developing meaningful humanitarian-based projects</li>
              <li>Provide support to nonprofits working kito help their communities either locally or globally</li>
              <li>Coding projects that benefit or support underprivileged communities</li>
              <li>Unifying minorities to code solutions for underrepresented communities</li>
